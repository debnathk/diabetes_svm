**Diabetes detection by Dimensionality Reduction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

•  Labelled **Diabetes dataset** were obtained from Kaggle containing **768 datapoints** with 500 patients positive for the disease and 268 were negative

•  **Dimensionality reduction** were performed using **PCA** and **LDA**, preceded by data pre-processing

•  **SVM classifier** with hyper-parameter tuning was employed for the binary classification task

•  **Accuracies** achieved in this task were **70.12 %** and **70.12 %** for validation and test set, respectively, after **PCA**

•  **Accuracies** achieved in this task were **79.22 %** and **76.62 %** for validation and test set, respectively, after **LDA**
